Bookmark app for Thinkful!

All the bookmarks have the following attributes title url link description rating (1-5)

The app still functions if the user omits any of the optional parameters(rating, description)

The user can see a list of their bookmarks when they open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link The user can remove bookmarks from the list by clicking the trash icon on the bottom right
